## Project Idea: 
-Use COVID-19 data from multiple websites. We found data on : test results (postitive and negative), deaths, hospital beds (available, occupied, etc.).
-We plan to break the database down to be sorted and merged by state.


## Type of Data:
 -We found two CSV files containing data on : test results (postitive and negative), deaths, hospital beds (available, occupied, etc.).
 -We will merge these two files on states to have data by each state available.

    Websites:
    https://covidtracking.com/data - daily testing data by state
    https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-abbreviations - states names and abbreviations


## Type of Database:
-We will use the Mongo database to publish our findings.

## Project Conclusion

Used COVID-19 data from [healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state/resource/1051acef-72b2-4fbc#{view-grid:{columnsWidth:[{column:!state,width:206},{column:!collection_date,width:243},{column:!Inpatient++Beds++Occupied++Estimated,width:368) and [covidtracking.com](https://covidtracking.com/data) to find correlations between number of positive covid-19 cases and estimated hospital beds occupied by covid patients.

##### [healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/covid-19-estimated-patient-impact-and-hospital-capacity-state/resource/1051acef-72b2-4fbc#{view-grid:{columnsWidth:[{column:!state,width:206},{column:!collection_date,width:243},{column:!Inpatient++Beds++Occupied++Estimated,width:368)
This data set was extracted by CSV and details statistical estimation with a 95% confidence interval for number and percentage of inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients for the given state and date. 


##### [covidtracking.com](https://covidtracking.com/data)
This data set was extracted by CSV and details US states summary Cases, Tests, and Outcomes numbers are simple sums of the data states provide, but because of the disparate metrics they include, they should be considered estimates.

These data sets where transformed by eleminating territories, sorting the data by state, changing the date column to dataTime, and filtering the data by a date window. The CSV's where joined on the state and date columns. There are two columns in the final data set that have state name one in the form of an abriviation and one with the full name written out. We left both these columns in the data set for readability since not all individuals will be familiar with state abriviations.
