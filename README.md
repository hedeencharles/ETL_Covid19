### Group Members: Charles Hedeen, Autum, Brock Vriesman, Audric Perger

## Project Idea: 
-Use COVID-19 data from multiple websites. We found data on : test results (postitive and negative), deaths, hospital beds (available, occupied, etc.).
-We plan to break the database down to be sorted and merged by state.


## Type of Data:
 -We found two CSV files containing data on : test results (postitive and negative), deaths, hospital beds (available, occupied, etc.).
 -We will merge these two files on states to have data by each state available.

    Websites:
    https://covidtracking.com/data - daily testing data by state
    https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-abbreviations - states names and abbreviations


## Type of Database:
-We will use the Mongo database to publish our findings.
